rBCI - Reddit Background Click Inhibitor

Inhibits clicks on the background of postings in the reddit feed that would accidentally open the posting. E.g. when you want to upvote a posting while browsing r/popular, and you accidentally click one pixel besides the arrow, reddit would open the posting and potentially mess up how far you already scrolled down the feed.
The script re-applies the click inhibition every second to accomodate for reddit fetching new content.
